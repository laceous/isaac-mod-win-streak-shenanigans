    <description>This mod allows you to pretend you're good at the game by easily incrementing your win streak via the debug console. It effectively ends the game multiple times.

Usage:
[code]
win-streak +10
[/code]

The max is limited here to 9999. This fits cleanly into the &quot;Best Streak&quot; space. On a new save file, this takes a couple seconds to complete. On a 100% save file, this can take a couple minutes to complete.

Once complete, a cutscene will play marking the end of your run. View your updated win streak in the menu.

This can unlock items like &quot;Ace of Clubs&quot; (3 win streak).

This mod doesn't work if you're in a challenge or seeded run. You also need to have beaten Mom once.</description>
