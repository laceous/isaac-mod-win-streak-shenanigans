    <description>This mod allows you to pretend you're good at the game by easily incrementing your win streak via the debug console. It effectively ends the game multiple times.

Usage:
[code]
win-streak +10
[/code]

The max is limited here to 9999. This fits cleanly into the &quot;Best Streak&quot; space. On a new save file, this takes a couple seconds to complete. On a 100% save file, this can take a couple minutes to complete.

Once complete, a cutscene will play marking the end of your run. View your updated win streak in the menu.

This can unlock items like &quot;Ace of Clubs&quot; (3 win streak).

This command doesn't work if you're in a challenge or seeded run. You also need to have beaten Mom once.

This mod also lets you easily increment your Eden tokens via the debug console.

Usage:
[code]
eden-tokens +10
[/code]

This works by moving you to the Mom's Heart boss fight (or Ultra Greed boss fight in Greed mode), triggering the room clear multiple times, and then ending the game. This will also increment your win streak by 1.

This command doesn't work if you're in a challenge, seeded run, or victory lap. You also need to have beaten Mom once.

This can unlock Eden, and other Mom's Heart (or Ultra Greed) related things.

This mod is now enhanced with REPENTOGON support. Press the tilde key to open the new debug console and menu. There's a new Shenanigans option that will let you set Win Streak, Best Win Streak, and Eden Tokens. You can set Win Streak and Eden Tokens directly overtop the character select carousel. Watch it update the UI in real-time. Best Win Streak might not save unless you start a new run.

Daily and Online Streak options have also been added.</description>
